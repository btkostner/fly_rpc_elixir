# Fly RPC & Postgres

This git repository is home to both Elixir packages `fly_rpc` and `fly_postgres`. These are
libraries to help Elixir developers more easily take advantage of the [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
platform.

The library `fly_postgres` depends on `fly_rpc` and builds upon it. For most
purposes, just start with [`fly_postgres`](./fly_postgres).
